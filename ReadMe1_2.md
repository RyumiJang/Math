============================================
## 1. Explanation of project
#####  -Solving Fill-a-Pix puzzle 
#####  -Fill-a-Pix is to figure out whether the color of each cell of NxM grid is white or black, based on given clues

## 3. How to use this code
#####  -You can use this code by using txt file and .c file in Linux.
#####  -Use Putty for execution
#####  -Compile and draft the txt file that you want to solve.
#####  -Text file : You must use **'?'** for blank cell and **"space(' ')"** for between cell and cell
#####  -When you draft the .txt file it should be written like ex) ./a.out **<** test.txt
