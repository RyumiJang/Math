DiscreteMath Assignment1-3 (Numbrix)
============================================
## 1. Explanation of project
#####  -This project name is ***Numbrix puzzle solving code*** 
#####  -Numbrix is puzzle consists of a N X M grid where some numbers between 1 and N X M are placed on some cells.
#####  -The goal of game is to place the remaining numbers between 1 and N X M on the grid such that two numbers x and x+1 are placed at vertucally of horizonally adjacent cell always(1 <= x < N x M) 
#####  -Our goal for this puzzle is to solve this puzzle using by ***Linear integer arithmetic logic***.
#####  -We will get input from standard input and print out standard output, and if there is no solution, print out no solution.

## 2. How to installation

## 3. How to use this code
#####  -You can use this code by using txt file and .c file in Linux.
#####  -I'll use Putty for execution
#####  -Compile and draft the txt file that you want to solve.
#####  -_In text File_: You must use _'?_for blank cell and _space_for between cell and cell
#####  -When you draft the .txt file it should be written like ex) ./a.out test.txt
#####  -Then you can see result of solved puzzle.
